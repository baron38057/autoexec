yo my dear cheaters >.<

i tried to find hunter ceiling script but... i found nothing.
so i decided to create my own script bcuz ai (like always) cant help u with scripts
To use script you need 

1) Download https://www.autohotkey.com
2) Download my script lol
3) Start script
4) Works on sensitivity 5.6 only, so u need to change it. (type in console ensitivity 5.6 )
5) In case of this is mine script, it works crookedly, so u cant hold ctrl while in air) 

HOW TO USE THIS ULTRA DIF SCRIPT?

1) FIND PLACE 4 CEILING
2) TARGET -89 ang (max ang)
3) IN AIR PRESS "X" ON YOUR KEYBOARD.

No holding ctrl in air*

rshift - close script.

Note: 
If you have sensitivity 3.3 change in
SPEED_Y := 411 ; 
to 
SPEED_Y := 694 ; 
If you have sensitivity 1.5
change 411 to 1530
